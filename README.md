Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.<br>
Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:<br>
1) Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
2) Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
3) Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

In this project I have used the Python library Keras to recognize the Images and the Neural Network is trained with the CIFAR10 dataset.

In the Above Image the Blue Rectangle show the Input Image. And the Red rectangle show the prediction.
